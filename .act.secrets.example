# Act Secrets for changelog-parser-action
# These secrets are used when running act locally
#
# Note: If you have secrets configured in ~/.actrc, you can leave these commented
# and act will use the values from ~/.actrc instead
#
# Copy this file to .act.secrets and uncomment/modify as needed:
# cp .act.secrets.example .act.secrets
#
# To use these values, uncomment and set them:
# - Remove the # at the beginning of the line
# - Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens

# GitHub Token (for testing GitHub API calls)
# This is automatically provided by act as GITHUB_TOKEN, but you can override it
# GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token

# Gitea Token (for testing self-hosted Gitea instances)
# Used for testing git.ravenwolf.org and other self-hosted instances
# GITEA_TOKEN=your_gitea_token_here

# Remote Git Token (for testing remote repository access)
# Used when testing with repo_url input
# REMOTE_GIT_TOKEN=your_remote_git_token_here
